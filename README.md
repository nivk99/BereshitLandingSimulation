Bereshit spacecraft unfortunately didn't manage to land properly on the moon, there are many speculations and thoughts about the real reason of this failure, alot of reasons can be found on the interenet or SpaceIL site.

The main goal of this simulator is try to make landing process successfully which will do it fully automatically using all sensors available in the craft.

We have here few parameters we count on: Vertical speed, Horizontal speed, distance, angle-rotation, alttitude,acceleration,fuel,weight.
