# Bereshit_Landing_Simulation

This simulation was built by inspiration of SpaceIL project - Bereshit. Which is mission to land on the moon, more details can be found - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceIL

Bereshit spacecraft unfortunately didn't manage to land properly on the moon, there are many speculations and thoughts about the real reason of this failure, alot of reasons can be found on the interenet or SpaceIL site.

The main goal of this simulator is try to make landing process successfully which will do it fully automatically using all sensors available in the craft.

We have here few parameters we count on: Vertical speed, Horizontal speed, distance, angle-rotation, alttitude,acceleration,fuel,weight.


In our work we will use PID more details can be found - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller
